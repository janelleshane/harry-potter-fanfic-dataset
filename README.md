Thanks to some heroic work by @b8horpet@tumblr in scraping (with permission) hundreds of thousands of Harry Potter fan fiction titles and summaries from AO3, here's a dataset of 111,963 Harry Potter fanfiction titles, authors, and summaries.

#
Scraping date: June 27, 2017

Site: Ao3's Harry Potter Fan Fiction repository

Format: Each fan fiction entry on a single line:

Title by Author | Summary text

#
Pre-cleaned to remove entries containing non-Roman characters (i.e. entries in Japanese and Arabic).

This also had the effect of barely bringing the file size below GitHub's 25MB limit.

There are still lots of entries in French, Spanish, German, etc, which may cause your algorithms some headaches.
